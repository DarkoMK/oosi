## Object-Oriented Software Engineering Seminar Project: Real-Time Color Marker Detection App

### Project Overview

This repository contains a mobile application developed as part of a seminar project in Object-Oriented Software Engineering. The application is built using the Flutter framework and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) machine learning framework. It's tailored for Android 9+ OS devices.

### Project Ratio

The primary goal of this project is to integrate cutting-edge technologies and object-oriented (OO) concepts. This encompasses a spectrum ranging from mobile app development to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The project serves as a platform for students to learn contemporary concepts and acquire practical experience in these fields.

### Project Aim

The aim is to provide students with an opportunity to learn and apply modern technologies and principles in a practical setting. By engaging with this project, students can enhance their understanding of object-oriented software engineering and gain hands-on experience in developing AI-enabled mobile applications.

### Project Task

The central task of this project is to develop a mobile application using the Flutter framework and the YOLO AI framework. The application is designed to detect color markers with specific patterns in real-time. Upon detection, the app will group these markers and translate their patterns into a corresponding JSON file. This functionality exemplifies the combination of mobile application development with AI, offering a practical example of how these technologies can be integrated.

### Target Audience

This project is intended for students studying Object-Oriented Software Engineering, as well as anyone interested in the practical application of mobile app development and AI technologies.

### Contribution

We welcome contributions and suggestions to improve the application. For more information on how to contribute, please refer to the contributing guidelines.
